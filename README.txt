CRAWLER

This is a crawler for wikipedia. Given a word as an input from the user
this script will scan the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page for the word.
If it does not find the word given it will add all the hyper-links it finds to a 
list of seeds and then walk through the list until it gets in contact with a page
containing the word given by the user.
